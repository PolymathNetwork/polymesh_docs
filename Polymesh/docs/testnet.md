The Alcyone Public Testnet was launched in September, replacing the previous Aldebaran Testnet.

Polymesh is a public, permissioned blockchain. Anyone can run a node, but only a permissioned group of operators can run an authoring node that produces new blocks.

Nodes can be viewed at:

Releases with binaries can be found at:

Please see our project README for more details on building and deploying a Polymesh node:

Alcyone has a number of dApps to allow users to onboard, manage assets and participate in governance.

There is a Polymesh Chrome Plugin wallet available in the Chrome store under "Polymesh Testing Wallet".

The Testnet POLY Bridge can be used to onboard onto the Alcyone testnet:

Tha Alcyone network is being continually upgraded as mainnet features are completed and ready to be shipped to the testnet. Network upgrades and other governance can be viewed at:

Once onboarded, the Polymesh Token Studio can be used to easily issue, manage and configure assets on Alcyone:
