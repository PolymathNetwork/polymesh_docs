Identity is at the core of Polymesh. Polymesh implements a federated root of trust via permissioned Customer Due Diligence service providers. Every transaction in Polymesh is associated with an identity.

Identities in Polymesh are controlled via keys - each identity must have a single primary key and can optionally have additional secondary keys.

Identities are a collection of keys, claims and assets.

- DIDs as references

- transaction signing vs. identity authentication

- collection of structured claims

- authentication methods (keys, multisigs, identity)

- CDD claims / identity creation
