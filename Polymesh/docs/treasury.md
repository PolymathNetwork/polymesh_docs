# Network Treasury

Polymesh has a special account, designated as the network treasury. This account collects a percentage of all fees and can also accept direct donations.

POLYX can only be disbursed from the treasury using the governance process, in particular by the submission and ratification of a PIP which represents a disbursement from the treasury to a specified acccount.

The intention is that treasury funds are disbursed to facilitate the adoption and development of Polymesh - it may be used for grants, direct payments to identities who perform specified actions for the network or any other purpose that the governance process deems reasonable.
