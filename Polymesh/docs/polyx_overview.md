# POLYX

POLYX is the utility token of the Polymesh network. It is used in Polymesh for staking, for both operators and non-operators, signalling on governance issues and paying for transactions on the network.

Polymath has an ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainnet, used for our Ethereum ST20 protocol. POLY ERC20 tokens can be swapped one-to-one for POLYX tokens on Polymesh via the bridge process (TODO: link).

Additional POLYX is only created when block rewards are minted to be paid to operators and stakers.

POLYX is held at the key level (TODO: link) and can be transferred between any keys which are associated with an identity that has a valid CustomerDueDiligence claim (TODO: link).
