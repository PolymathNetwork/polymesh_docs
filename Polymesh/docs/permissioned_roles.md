## Overview

Polymesh is a public network, so anyone can run a node, receive network and state updates and check that the blockchain is progressing as expected.

Different roles on the Polymesh network have different levels of permissioning required, all managed through the on-chain [governance](./governance.md) process.

## Network Users

All users of Polymesh go through a [Customer Due Diligence](cdd.md) process. With a valid CDD claim, a user can send and receive POLYX and interact with the Polymesh primitives to create and manage their identities and assets, settle instructions and so on.

## Operators

Operators nodes are special nodes in the Polymesh network which author new blocks, and participate in finalising the blockchain.

Unlike a permissionless network, in order to run an operator node, a user must be permissioned through the on-chain governance process. This is done via a [Polymesh Improvement Proposal](./governance.md).

## Customer Due Diligence Service Providers

Unlike other claims, only certain permissioned identities are allowed to issue CDD claims. These are companies that offer an onboarding service to Polymesh users, providing a fast and simple due diligence process and identity creation.

CDD service providers are added and removed via a PIP executed through the on-chain governance process.

## Committee Membership

Committees are able to send PIPs directly to the Governing Council for ratification. There may be several committees, each with a different specialisation and membership.

A committee manages their own membership, voting to add or remove new members.

## Governing Council Membership

The Governance Coucil ratify and reject PIPs and schedule their execution. Like committees, the governing council manage their own membership via their usual voting process.
