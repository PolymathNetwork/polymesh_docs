# Signalling

It is important that PIPs are curated by community members (POLYX token holders) to provide feedback to the Governance Council on the relative importance to the community of different PIPs.

Any POLYX token holder, in addition to being able to submit a PIP for consideration, can signal their view on other community submitted PIPS, both postiviely or negatively, by bonding POLYX to the relevant PIP. The POLYX token holders signal is proportional to the amount of POLYX bonded by that community member.

When the Governance Council triggers a PIP snapshot, we take these signals and use them to order the community submitted PIPs for consideration by the Governance Council.

Currently we take a linear count of positive and negative signals and use these to order PIPs, but in the future we can consider more expressive mechanisms, such as quadratic voting by leveraging our confidential identity model (TODO: Link).

Token holders can unbond their POLYX and remove their support (or lack of support) from a PIP at any time. Bonding POLYX to signal on different PIPs does not prevent token holders from staking their POLYX.
