## Overview

POLYX is the native token of Polymesh and is used to stake and transact on the network.

POLYX provides security to the Polymesh network by:

- metering the cost of compute and storage through [transaction fees](./fees.md) preventing Denial of Service attacks

- incentivising correct behaviour by operators by rewarding them for acting correctly, and penalizing them for downtime or inconsistent data.

## POLY / POLYX Total Supply

Polymath has an ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainnet - [POLY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9992ec3cf6a55b00978cddf2b27bc6882d88d1ec), with a fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000 POLY.

The POLY to POLYX bridge converts these ERC20 POLY tokens to POLYX on the Polymesh network on a one for one basis. Bridging POLY to POLYX does not effect the total supply.

In addition, to reward operators and stakers, the Polymesh network protocol mints rewards at the end of each era which are distributed pro-rata to operators and stakers.
