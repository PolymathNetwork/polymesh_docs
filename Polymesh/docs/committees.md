# Committees

Polymesh governance includes committees. Each committee is a group of identities which a specific remit to manage certain types of network changes.

Each committee has a membership, with the current members being responsible for voted new members in or existing members out.

Associated with each committee is a voting threshold - for example, if the committee has 5 members, and a threshold of 50%, then at least 3 members of the committee must agree on an action before it is executed by the committee.

Committees can submit PIPs which are included are then put in front of the Goverance Council for consideration. The Governance Council can choose to ratify, reject or ignore a committee submitted PIP.

Unlike community submitted PIPs, a committee submitted PIP is not subject to signalling from the community of POLYX token holders, and is always eligable for actioning by the Governance Council.
